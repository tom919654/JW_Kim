ðŸ‘‹ Hi Y'all! Iâ€™m a M.S. student @KAIST, Graduate School of AI (GSAI). My research focuses on high-dimensional vision challenges, including 3D reconstruction, videos, and 4D generation. Recently, I have been exploring how to learn representations in high-dimensional vision spaces by leveraging the power of 2D vision foundation models. I strongly believe that bridging the gap between 2D vision and higher-dimensional vison tasks holds the key to conquer this field.
