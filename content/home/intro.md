👋 Hi Y'all! I’m an incoming M.S. student @KAIST, Graduate School of AI (GSAI). I’m interested in solving inverse problems. My recent research topics are neural radiance fields and generative models such as diffusion and GAN. I believe generative neural radiance field can efficiently represent real-world 3D space with only 2D images.
